# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Project

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction project repository. In this project, I employed a variety of advanced techniques to create an efficient and accurate model for classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. The primary goal of this project is to contribute to medical diagnostics by developing a robust model that aids in identifying breast cancer cases with high precision.

## Project Overview

- Explored the domain of breast cancer diagnosis prediction.
- Utilized advanced techniques for feature extraction, scaling, model selection, and evaluation.
- Developed a classification model to predict benign and malignant cases.

## Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction

- Leveraged Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
- Reduced the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving essential information.
- Eliminated redundant features and enhanced the model's performance.

## Standardization through Feature Scaling

- Emphasized the importance of feature scaling as a critical preprocessing step.
- Ensured all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.
- Improved model convergence and efficiency during training.

## Classification Models

- Explored K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models.
- Selected Logistic Regression based on exceptional accuracy score and performance metrics.
- Leveraged the Confusion Matrix for assessing the model's predictive capabilities.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- Evaluated the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Validated the model's ability to correctly identify malignant cases while minimizing false positives and negatives.
- Achieved high precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating robust predictive capabilities.
